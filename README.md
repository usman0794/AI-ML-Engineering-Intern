# Fake News Detection

## Overview
This project aims to detect fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The model is trained to classify news as either fake or real based on the content of the articles.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Jupyter Notebook

## Features
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, stopword removal, lemmatization)
- Vectorization using CountVectorizer
- Model training and evaluation
- Accuracy and classification report

## Usage
Run the notebook or script to train and test the model. The trained model is saved using joblib for reuse.

## Outcome
A basic fake news detection system that classifies news content with good accuracy.

# Customer Segmentation Using Clustering

## Overview
This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to segment mall customers based on demographic and spending data. It helps in understanding different customer types for better marketing strategies.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- K-Means Clustering

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- K-Means clustering and Elbow Method
- Visualization of customer segments

## Usage
Run the notebook to explore data, perform clustering, and view visualizations.

## Outcome
Customer segments identified based on income and spending patterns, useful for targeted marketing.

# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of movie reviews using machine learning. It classifies reviews as positive or negative based on their content.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NLTK, Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes / SVM
- TF-IDF Vectorization

## Features
- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, stopword removal, tokenization)
- Sentiment classification using ML models
- Model evaluation (accuracy and F1-score)
- (Optional) User interface for review prediction

## Usage
Run the notebook to train and test the model. Optionally, try the interface for custom reviews.

## Outcome
A sentiment analysis model that helps understand user opinions from movie reviews.
